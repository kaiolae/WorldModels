To start the worldmodels virtualenv:
export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
workon worldmodels

#To run a single core, a single window
python 05_train_controller.py car_racing --num_worker 1 --num_worker_trial 4 --num_episode 16 --max_length 1000 --eval_steps 25

---------

Progress so far:

-Implemented a VAE
-Set up code to unroll episodes in 01_...py
-Made a script that runs multiple workers, each unrolling a batch of episodes: sh generate_random_rollouts.bash
-Resulting rollouts get stored in data/
-Checked Rollouts in notebook. Looking good! Time to feed into VAE.
-Fixed data loading in the VAE. Running small (1 batch) test now.

TODO:
-generating a bunch of rollouts in data/ over the weekend. Take a look at them.
-train VAE with those rollouts
-Test VAE in notebook. Hardmaru had code for that.
